title: Your Grandmother's Browser
---

So the question is, why bother with your Grandmother's browser?  Why develop for browsers that are craptastic and don't make your life easy?  (Yes we're talking about IE any version, obvi)  Shouldn't we just leave them behind like all failures of industry?

Perhaps, but first let's ask why?  Why are people still using bad browsers?  Well... ignorance and money.  Some people just flat out don't know that browsers are different.  They go onto the internet and do very simple tasks, on very simple websites, and they don't know that, should they venture off to a trendy spot of the web, their browser may let them down.  While eating breakfast not too long ago, I overheard a very opinionated man tell some "Little Lady" that there was no difference between browsers, they all did the same thing, and it didn't matter what you used.  I wanted very badly to jump in and correct him, but my bacon was yummy, so I just glared and chewed, glared and chewed.  Truth is, many people use the internet, but if you were born too far before it existed, you probably don't LOVE the internet.

The other problem is money, and before you say browsers are free, I'm talking Wall Street money.  I'm talking corporations who want you to spend all of your money while they spend as little of thier own as possible.  Those guys.  Most of the cutting edge browsers don't let them control the browsers the way they'd like, and it's expensive for them to update all they have out on the web.

It should be noted that yes, some low-income families may not have the best computers, but c'mon this is America, you can get a phone this Black Friday or a cheap computer capable of a good browser.

So, why do we web developers bother?  It's not because we are thinking of our Grandmothers, it's because our bosses are thinking about thier bosses, and they are thinking about shareholders, who are thinking if they don't see a good return, their grandmothers will end up at Shady Pines.  Personally, I think the ignorant users will convert.  Throw a message up and tell them "Too bad", and they will update.  The real problem is business.  They want to extend the cost of upgrading as far out as possible, but that just makes me wonder why we developers don't ban together and say, "NOPE, pay us!"  Make it rain!  With every slip of the IE market share, we experience job security and a comfy lifestyle!
