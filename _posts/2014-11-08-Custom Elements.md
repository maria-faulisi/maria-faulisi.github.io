title: Custom Elements
---

  Getting critical...Ok, so I do see some potential issues with web components that are no different from other problems I see out on the web now.  Primarily overuse.  Yes, it is possible that some developers could go a little cray with custom elements.  Let's face it, web developers are a clever bunch, and many of us love solving problems so much, we solve problems even when they don't exist!  
  
  It's possible to have a developer question the very fundamental elements that have been used for years.  Why does a `<p>` have to be a `<p>` tag?  Sure the web is based on the idea of academic writing, but isn't that obsolete now?  Let's redo all of the tags making them semantic for the web as it is used!  I say let's do away with `<p>` long live the `<words>` tag!  Obviously, I jest, but that could happen.  The fundamentals of the web could be rewritten on a per site basis which would seriously degrade the universal basis that we need.  We need it for SEO, for budding developers' education, for sanity!

  Then you have the potential for over simplification!  If everyone creates custom widgets that solve complex web issues using a simple tag, will future developers even BE developers?!  Maybe not.  
  
  Remember buying rolls of film?  How about using flash cartridges?  No?  Yea, it was hard for me to move to digital, and it irks me when I spend time setting my aperture, agonizing over my f-stop and considering the ISO of my imaginary film to capture perfection only to have someone tap an iPhone and create the same thing!  But in going digital I gained the ability to shoot 5,000 photos without any cost increases, I NEVER get photos back from processing with a finger in the frame or have shoe boxes full of negatives. Everything that seeks to improve the way we do things has trade-offs. I'm optimistic, but it took me years to feel that way, and the only alternative is to stay put and smile for 20 minutes while I take your Daguerreotype!
