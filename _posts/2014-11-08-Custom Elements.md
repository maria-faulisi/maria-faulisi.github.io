title: Custom Elements
---

  Getting critical...Ok, so I do see some potential issues with web components that are no different from other problems I see out on the web now.  Primarily overuse.  Yes, it is possible that some developers could go a little cray with custom elements.  Let's face it, web developers are a clever bunch, and many of us love solving problems so much, we solve problems even when they don't exist!  
  
  It's possible to have a developer question the very fundamental elements that have been used for years.  Why does a `<p>` have to be a `<p>` tag?  Sure the web is based on the idea of academic writing, but isn't that obsolete now?  Let's redo all of the tags making them semantic for the web as it is used!  I say let's do away with `<p>` long live the `<words>` tag!
