title: A Game of Shark and Minnow
---

So I checked out the interactive article entitled [A Game of Shark and Minnow](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/) published by the New York Times this weekend.  The article covers issues regarding tense relations between a few countries over a fertile group of reef in the South China Sea.  On first viewing I was uber impressed.  

These types of foreign affairs (and if I'm being honest most foreign affairs) are not my preferred reading subjects.  Had it not been for the interactive nature of the article, I doubt I would have given this topic more than a moments glance.  The interactive components of the article were so rich and well done that I couldn't help but spend a lot of time scrolling and re-scrolling through it.  It should be noted that I viewed this article on a 17 inch laptop, and was able to get the full experience my first time around.

When I looked at the article the second time I used my phone and was disappointed that much of the cool interactivity had been lost.  No slick transition from video to google maps, no video at all actually.  No scrolling text over rich images, just images and text where the fun interactivity had been.

If the aim of journalism is to increase interactivity to entice readers, this article hit the nail on the head, unless you're mobile.  Then it's just another blah blah article about blah blah South China Sea blah blah reefs.
