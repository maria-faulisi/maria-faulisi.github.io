title: Native Apps vs. Web Apps
---

If you ask me on any given day how many strong feelings I have on any topics, I'd say, "Not many."  I don't have a lot of strong feels that I would stand up for, but when discussing native apps versus web apps, I have some strong feels indeed!  It's like debating on oils vs. acrylics or Nikon vs. Canon... I am invested in a camp and I want to think it's the best camp.  I mean hello, I'm in it! ;)

I'm pretty pragmatic and my current camp of choice is Web app.  For me, native apps smack of over specialization.  It's not like native apps don't have to access the web... many of them depend on it!  It's true that web apps still have a ways to go as far as tapping into hardware components (such as accelerometers) and the UI elements that are baked into phones and tablets, but it's only a matter of time.  Heck, we're already on our way! \*cough\* GetUserMedia() \*cough\*

If you read my last post, (and I know you have ;)) you'd recognize my stance...It all comes down to users and businesses.
