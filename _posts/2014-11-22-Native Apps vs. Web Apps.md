title: Native Apps vs. Web Apps
---

If you ask me on any given day how many strong feelings I have on any topics, I'd say, "Not many."  I don't have a lot of strong feels that I would stand up for, but when discussing native apps versus web apps, I have some strong feels indeed!  It's like debating on oils vs. acrylics or Nikon vs. Canon... I am invested in a camp and I want to think it's the best camp.  I mean hello, I'm in it! ;)

I'm pretty pragmatic and my current camp of choice is Web app.  For me, native apps smack of over specialization.  It's not like native apps don't have to access the web... many of them depend on it!  It's true that web apps still have a ways to go as far as tapping into hardware components (such as accelerometers) and the UI elements that are baked into phones and tablets, but it's only a matter of time.  Heck, we're already on our way! \*cough\* GetUserMedia() \*cough\*

If you read my last post (and I know you have) you'd recognize my stance...It all comes down to users and businesses or experience and profit.  There are some amazing web experiences out there.  To say that they will never compete with native apps is crazytown talk.  We may not be there yet, but we will be, and perhaps our corporate friends will help us get there.  No company that has invested time and money into developing a native app is doing so without a traditional website as well.  So these companies are paying to make websites that must be tweaked for many different browsers (including mobile browsers) as well as apps that must be tweaked for iOS and android phones and tablets.  It is definately in thier interest to push web app.  It just makes sense.  Originally, Apple didn't allow for native apps, because...it doesn't make sense to over-specialize. (I know there are other reasons, but this one is self-serving)

Of course, now Apple is all over native apps, and why is that?  Oh yea, profit.  But I think they had it right the first time.  Robust web apps are just a dream deferred and as the web passes through it's awkard teen years, it will blossom into a strong superstar of capability.  Phones and tablets are just mini computers, and as engineers continue to push the bounds of what they are capable of, I'm sure they will integrate safe component access and leave the web experience/software to the web.  Think of this:  You can't buy the Adobe suite anymore...you CANNOT buy the Adobe suite anymore... nuff said.
