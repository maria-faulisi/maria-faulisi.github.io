##Why I'm here

Well I'm here so that I don't hate what I do for a living any longer.  As you may remember from our first day of class, I'm an old fine arts major and that didn't get me too far.  I ended up working in sales, which I was good at, but hated.  Two years ago I decided, "I can't go on... :weary:"  So I took stock of my skills with an eye on change.  I looked at those skills and thought..Graphic Design/Advertising!  Then I trolled around the internet and thought...INTERNET!  

I've suffered a few migraines learning some of my new skills...I'm looking at you Intro to Programming, but I'm really happy with my choice to study web development.  One of the most comforting things I've come to appreciate about web technologies are thier somewhat unforgiveable nature.  If you don't know what you're doing, if you execute something incorrectly, it simply does not work.  It's a two fold battle, on one hand you must be technically precise, on the other hand you have to think in terms of expression and how your work is being perceived from a creative standpoint.  I don't think I'll ever hate what I do for a living again.  :+1:      

###Current Inspiration

- [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/)
Part of being a creative is setting your standards high...seeing strong work by peers...helps.
- [The Caves of Lascaux](http://www.lascaux.culture.fr/?lng=en#/fr/00.xml)
So I'm pretty practical..I work hardest on what I know least until my skills are evened out..then I have fun again.  This inspires me from a technical standpoint.
- [The Johnny Cash Project](http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/)
This project inspires me because it reflects the cultural and connective powers of web development.  Taking thousands of individual components and combining them into a single piece is really how the web works.  I hope to make something cool like this one day.
