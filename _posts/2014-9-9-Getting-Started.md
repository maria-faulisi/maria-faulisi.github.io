##Why I'm here

Well I'm here so that I don't hate what I do for a living any longer.  As you may remember from our first day of class, I'm an old fine arts major and that didn't get me too far.  I ended up working in sales, which I was good at, but hated.  Two years ago I decided, "I can't go on... :weary:"  So I took stock of my skills with an eye on change.  I looked at those skills and thought..Graphic Design/Advertising!  Then I trolled around the internet and thought...INTERNET!  

I've had a few migraines learning some of my new skills...I'm looking at you Intro to Programming, but I'm pretty resilient.  Now with one more semester to go...I'm happy.

So I'm pretty practical..I work hardest on what I know least until my skills are evened out..then I have fun again.  This inspires me from a technical standpoint.
